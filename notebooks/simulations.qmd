## Setup

```{python}
from src.experiments import experiment_unbalanced_size
```

# 1. Simple case
We simulate a two class problem $y\in{0,1}$. Both classes are drawn from a Guassian with $\mu_0=-1$ and $\mu_2=1$. We compute the AUC of the ROC and the Accuracy, both pooled or averaged across folds. 

```{python}
experiment_unbalanced_size(pos_ratio = 0.1, n_samples = 100)
```
